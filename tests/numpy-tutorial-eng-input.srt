dear friends we are going to look into

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,810
numpy by module today it is extremely

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,870
popular in Python community and it is

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,139
heavily used for scientific computing we

5
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:12,509
will see why it is so popular so let's

6
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:14,730
first start by installing it I will

7
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,060
install it using pip you can run pip

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,170
install numpy white come on to download

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,310
and install it while it is installing

10
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,340
numpy wise main object is n dimensional

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,729
array okay so we will look into that

12
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:38,160
array so here I have my Python Idol

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,790
shall open and I'm going to import numpy

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:47,309
Y model here so num I've imported it as

15
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:52,829
NP and to create an array object you

16
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,910
will use NP dot array and in this

17
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,750
bracket you just pass down your list so

18
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,270
this is my num P Y array if you look

19
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,510
into it now this is sort of similar to a

20
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,090
list it is actually very similar to a

21
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,180
list you can access the elements by

22
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,460
index it looks like a list so the

23
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,400
question is I only have a list why do I

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,299
need this number by array well there are

25
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,130
several benefits of using numpy array.
