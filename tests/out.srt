dear friends we are going to look into
numpy by module today it is extremely

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:10,139
popular in Python community and it is
heavily used for scientific computing we

3
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:14,730
will see why it is so popular so let's
first start by installing it I will

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:22,170
install it using pip you can run pip
install numpy white come on to download

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:29,340
and install it while it is installing
numpy wise main object is n dimensional

6
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:38,160
array okay so we will look into that
array so here I have my Python Idol

7
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:47,309
shall open and I'm going to import numpy
Y model here so num I've imported it as

8
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:56,910
NP and to create an array object you
will use NP dot array and in this

9
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:06,270
bracket you just pass down your list so
this is my num P Y array if you look

10
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:12,090
into it now this is sort of similar to a
list it is actually very similar to a

11
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,460
list you can access the elements by
index it looks like a list so the

12
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:24,299
question is I only have a list why do I
need this number by array well there are

13
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,130
several benefits of using numpy array.
